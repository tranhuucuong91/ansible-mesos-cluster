=========

Installs Docker with Ansible, using the get.docker.io script for Ubuntu based systems and the ```docker-io``` from EPEL for Centos/RHEL 6.5. 

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: mhamrah/docker }
